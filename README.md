# PSVR2
Attempt at making the PSVR2 work under Linux

This is initially for notes and if I get to it any code.

Intention:
I love space flight/combat games, think Wing Commander and Freespace 2, would like to use a PSVR2 as a cheap VR headset of decent visual quality under Linux.

Hardware I'm using for this:
- AMD 5700XT
- NVIDIA T550U
- Intel Alder Lake-UP3 GT2
- Intel 12th Gen i7-1265U
- PSVR2 updated to latest firmware on PS5
- PSVR to PC Adapter

Objectives and priority:
- Find howto switch PSVR2 into VR Mode - Highest
- Find howto switch PSVR2 between VR and Real World Mode
- Find howto engage inside out tracking - High
- Bluetooth controllers/controller tracking - Low
